# Kanzen

## Description
Kanzen is a static site where you can choose your favorite Japanese food.

- You can choose whatever Japanese food you like to order and it has a variety of different types of food. Then it will automatically calculate the price, tax and the total amount.
- I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make this project. This saves the data in local storage.  I hope to make this responsive.

## How to Run the Project
Just clone this and open the **home.html**.

## How to Use the Project
#### You can choose different types of food.

#### Click the add button below the product. And as you can see, the product that you order will appear on the order menu section. In this example, I order one hotate and two matcha. The price will calculate for each product accordingly. You could also click the "x icon" to remove that product.

#### There are six different types of food. I go to the pizza section and all the pizza shows up to choose from. Now I add two products and click three times yakiniku and one time on miso pizza. The items also increase according to the product I chose.
